# Python-Implementations
Basic Code for Algorithms

Hi everyone,

Considering this is my first text mining project in Python, I hope this code is of great help to beginning data analyst.
There isn't any topic modeling or LDA in this notebook and that is on purpose; the goal of this code
is to be able to scrape data of the web in the most automated way possible and by the results, I definitely feel I 
succeeded in doing this. If you are currently beginning your journey in web scraping/text analytics, reach out to me with 
any questions. I'd be glad to help!
