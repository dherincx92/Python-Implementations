This was my first (and _very_ mediocore) attempt at uploading something to Github. While I was successful, I was still developing in Jupyter notebooks.
At this point in my coding career, I had no knowledge of Python PEP8 conventions or even how to build a basic production repository, but nonetheless I
keep this repository as a reminder of my journey as a developer. This notebook was my final project for my Big Data and algorithms class at Michigan
State University.

A few months later I found myself in Washington, DC at Gallup where my coding career _really_ took off. If you're browsing my profile and you're just
starting to learn how to code, let me share this with you: May this repo server as an inspiration for you to keep working at it. Heck, I'm sure you're
already a better coder than me :)


Cheers,
Derek Herincx
